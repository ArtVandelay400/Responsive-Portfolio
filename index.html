    <p>I am a Denver native who has lived in Colorado for most of my life. I love living here and am a big fan of all the Denver sports teams. I also enjoy hiking, cooking, gardening, and gaming. I'm married and have a dog and two cats.</p>
    <p>I am currently employed as a Sales Engineer for a software company and am hoping the skills I learn in the bootcamp will help me operate in my current position more effectively, as well as increase my options in the job market.</p>
    <p>So far, I've found the class challenging but fun. While we cover a lot in each class, I feel infromation is delivered in manageable chunks and there's a lot of support along the way. I'm looking forward to learning Javascript and a lot of the more logic/programming driven aspects of web development.</p>
